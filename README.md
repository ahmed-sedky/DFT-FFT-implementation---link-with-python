# DFT-FFT-implementation---link-with-python
This is a sub task in paroject dsp to implement DFT and FFT manualy in c++ and link it with python 
then calulate the time of DFT to prove that it's of time complexity N^2 and FFT 's time complexity is NlogN
and calculate the error between them and plot the Time ANd The error
